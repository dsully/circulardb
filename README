CircularDB is an on disk time series data storage format & library.

Similar to RRDTool, but with cleaner, smaller code base & API.

Optimized for writes, no averaging of data is done unless you ask for it.

Some basic statistics are available, and ride on top of the GSL library:

http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

There is no graphing built in at this point.
I recommend using Flot: http://code.google.com/p/flot/

Documentation needs creating / improving.
